# ðŸ§  NeuroAnalysis Project ðŸ§ 

Throughout the summer of 2020, I spent a significant amount of time doing my own neuroscience research. This mainly consisted of first educating myself further about how neuro-imaging and neuro-imaging analysis works and then moving onto exploratory analysis of where to find datasets and how to load/analyze them. I quickly came across several packages such as nilearn and brainiak and incorporated them with already known machine learning packages (sci-kit learn) and other built in Python statistical analysis tools.


##
Brainiak ended up being a really great way for me to familiarize myself with fMRI data, learn about how it works and is organized, and analyze it in an interactive manner. After downloading all the datasets from the [brainiak](https://brainiak.org/tutorials/) website, I opened the tutorials and began to fill in missing code. I essentially used these tutorial notebooks as a basic framework to get me started before applying my own analyses, visualizations, and explanations of the results. 


## Viewing notebooks

Please read through the notebooks as you would an academic paper. All completed notebooks are in the brainiak_notebooks folder. Some are extensive and contain many visualizations and brain plots. For a brief overview, I recommend reading just the introduction, Goal, and Conclusion sections. 

These notebooks can be pulled and run on their own although they require a large dataset to be downloaded from https://zenodo.org/record/2598755. More detailed instructions can be found here (note: this will only download the data, these notebooks are simply outlines).

## Extension 
Learning is a constant journey and I don't anticipate stopping anytime soon. I will likely continue to upload to this repository with mini projects, such as my seizure classifier mini project I'm working on now. Check back in occasionally to see new projects. 

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

Sean Traynor (Tufts University) was a collaborator on this project, primarily working on editing, debugging, and formatting of Jupyter notebooks.
